# Example: Using Remote Markdown Linting Configuration
#
# This example shows how another repository would use the markdown
# linting configuration from this repository.
#
# Simply copy this file to your repository's root as `lefthook.yml`,
# update the git_url to point to your organization's fork,
# and run `lefthook install`.

remotes:
  - git_url: https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/lefthook
    ref: main  # or use a specific version tag like v1.0.0

# That's it! The remote configuration will provide:
#   - install hook: Pulls the Docker image
#   - pre-commit hook: Auto-formats markdown files
#   - pre-push hook: Validates markdown files
#
# You can add additional hooks below if needed:
#
# pre-commit:
#   commands:
#     your-custom-command:
#       run: echo "Running custom pre-commit check"
