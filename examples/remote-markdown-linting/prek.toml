# Example: Using Remote Markdown Linting Configuration with Prek
#
# This example shows how another repository would use the markdown
# linting configuration from this repository.
#
# Simply copy this file to your repository's root as `prek.toml`,
# update the url to point to your organization's fork,
# and run `prek install`.

[settings]
# TTY detection for VS Code compatibility
# When running in non-TTY mode, stderr is suppressed
colors = "auto"
verbose = false

[settings.tty]
detect = true
suppress_stderr_when_no_tty = true
quiet_when_no_tty = true

[remotes.markdown]
url = "https://github.com/sheldonhull/preflight"
ref = "main"  # or use a specific version tag like v1.0.0
config = "prek-markdown.toml"

# That's it! The remote configuration will provide:
#   - install hook: Pulls the Docker image
#   - pre-commit hook: Auto-formats markdown files (and stages them!)
#   - pre-push hook: Validates markdown files
#
# Key features:
#   - Auto-stages fixed files (no extra manual step needed)
#   - TTY detection for VS Code compatibility
#   - Suppresses stderr in non-interactive mode
#
# You can add additional hooks below if needed:
#
# [hooks.pre-commit.commands.your-custom-command]
# name = "Custom pre-commit check"
# run = "echo 'Running custom check'"
